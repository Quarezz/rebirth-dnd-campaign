Process the files that were just synced from Obsidian to Quartz.

STEP 1: Read @.sync-log.txt to see which files were changed/added

STEP 2: For each changed file, read it and analyze:
- Type of content (Character, Location, Quest, Session Note)
- Entities mentioned that need cross-references
- New information added

STEP 3: Update cross-references:
- Add links between related entities using [EntityName](EntityName.md)
- Link characters to locations, quests, and session notes
- Link quests to locations and participants
- ALWAYS link to Session Notes where entities are mentioned

STEP 4: Update ALL index files:
- Персонажі/Всі_персонажі.md (if characters changed)
- Локації/Всі_локації.md (if locations changed)
- Квести/Всі_квести.md (if quests changed)
- Хронологія_подій.md (if session notes added)
- content/index.md (update with latest events)

STEP 5: CRITICAL - Fact-check everything against session notes

STEP 6: Report all modifications made

Remember: All content in Ukrainian, accuracy over completeness.

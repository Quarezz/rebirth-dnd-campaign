Process the files that were just synced from Obsidian to Quartz content folder.

STEP 1: Read the sync log at @.sync-log.txt to see which files were changed/added

STEP 2: For each changed file in the sync log, read it and analyze:
- What type of content it is (Character, Location, Quest, Session Note)
- What entities are mentioned that need cross-references
- What new information was added

STEP 3: Update cross-references and links:
- Add links between related entities using [EntityName](EntityName.md) format
- Link characters to locations where they appear
- Link quests to locations where they occur
- Link characters to quests they participate in
- ALWAYS link to the Session Notes where entities are mentioned

STEP 4: Update ALL index files:
- Персонажі/Всі_персонажі.md (if character files changed)
- Локації/Всі_локації.md (if location files changed)
- Квести/Всі_квести.md (if quest files changed)
- Хронологія_подій.md (if session notes were added)
- content/index.md (update with latest events)

STEP 5: CRITICAL - Fact-check everything:
- Read the relevant session notes to verify all information
- Cross-reference character details, events, and relationships
- Correct any false information
- Update existing files if new information contradicts previous content

STEP 6: Report what was updated:
- List all files that were modified
- Summarize the changes made
- Note any inconsistencies found and corrected

STEP 7: In the main index - make sure to add latest events and update them as per latest notes

Remember: 
- All content must be in Ukrainian
- Accuracy is more important than completeness
- Never add information not present in session notes
- ALWAYS verify facts against source material
